            <p><strong>Hello I am Sapire, a Senior In High School that's studying Computer Programming and dabbling a little bit with CryptoCurrency. As of Right now I know a few Coding Languages and use four IDE's. I am Running a Youtube Channel with over 7,000 Subscribers and my main Point now for the Channel is Making AI's that beats games as fast as possible. I have Future Goals that people say I can't complete but I'm ready to prove them wrong. My strengths is combining with ideas. The downfall of that is that I would have other people talk about ideas and I combine them but change them up to work together. A Few Projects I am currently working on is a game called Overseas and RoboCity. With overSeas i am the only developer for the game and with RodoCity i have a team of working working on the game. Our goal is to get the game out before summer starts. </strong></p>
